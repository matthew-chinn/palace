		<h2>Rules: </h2>
		<div id="firstinstruction" class="activeInstruction"><p>
		The objective of the game is to get rid of all your cards. The
		players start with three facedown cards and six cards in their hand.
		From those six cards, choose three cards (preferably the three "best"
		cards, which will be defined later) and place them on top of the
		facedown cards. </p></div>
		
		<div id="secondinstruction" class="hidden"><p>
		In general, players must play a card(s) with a greater than or equal to
		value than the previous card, on their turn. If they have multiple
		cards of the same value (e.g. three Kings), then they can play any
		number of them, provided it is a higher value than the previous card.
		The higher value cards are the larger ones, from a low of 3 to a high of Ace,
		except for the three wild cards: 2, 7, 10. </p> </div>

		<div id="thirdinstruction" class="hidden"><p>
		 2, 7, and 10 all can be played after
		any previous card regardless of its value, and they have special
		effects. The 2 allows the player to play another card, the 7 requires
		the following player to play a card <em>lower</em> than 7, and the 10
		is a "bomb", which discards all the cards in the current pile then
		allows the player to play again. Also, four consecutive cards of the 
		same value counts as a bomb </p> </div>

		<div id="fourthinstruction" class="hidden"><p>
		After playing a card, draw a card(s) from the deck until you
		have at least 3 cards. If you cannot beat the current card, then you
		must take all of the pile into your hand. After the entire deck has
		been drawn and players have emptied their hands, they may use the three
		face up cards they had chosen at the beginning. After those, players
		must choose the facedown cards at random to play, and normal play
		continues until someone uses up all their cards</p></div>
